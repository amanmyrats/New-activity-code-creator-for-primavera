# New-activity-code-creator-for-primavera
Code fetches all project activities and create new and nice looking activity IDs.

In order to make this code work, we have to stick some format in excel  file.
First sheet we have to give info about our server, database, username and password etc. 
When you choose server name, database names are also updated automatically.

Second sheet "Dokum" will be the output.

Third sheet "Coding" will contain all the codes for the Activity IDs.

In excel vba code, we have 7 modules.
Here are the module names:
  CreateTable_Module
  dotheSteps_Module
  getActivity_Module
  importWBS_Module
  renkle_Module
  variables_Module
  
  *I could not upload sample excel file. If anyone know how to deal with this issue please let me know.
